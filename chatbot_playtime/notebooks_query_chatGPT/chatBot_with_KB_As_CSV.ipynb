    "### Question Answering Over Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Although LLMs are powerful, they do not know about information they were not trained on. If you want to use an LLM to answer questions about documents it was not trained on, you have to give it information about those documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that for every question you want to ask chatGPT, you first do a retrieval step to fetch any relevant documents and then pass those documents, along with the original question, to the language model and have it generate a response. \n",

    "- Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\n",

      "As more and more people become conscious of the impact that fossil fuels are having on our planet, there is an increasing demand for clean, renewable energy sources that can power our daily lives. One of the most promising solutions to this problem is the electric vehicle (EV), which uses electric motors instead of internal combustion engines to power its wheels. But as with any new technology, there can be confusion and uncertainty about how to use it, which is why EV Universe is here to help. \n",
      "\n",
      "EV Universe is a comprehensive resource for all things electric vehicles, providing information on everything from the best EV models on the market to how to find and use public charging stations. With its intuitive interface and user-friendly approach, EV Universe is the perfect tool for anyone looking to make the switch to electric vehicles. In this blog post, we’ll explore how people can use EV Universe to make the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing the Right EV Model\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for anyone considering an EV is simply understanding the different models available and which one would be the best fit for their needs. EV Universe makes this process as easy as possible by providing detailed information on all the latest electric car models, including their specs, features, and pricing. Users can compare different models side by side, read reviews from other EV owners, and even take virtual test drives to get a better sense of how each car handles on the road. This information can be crucial in helping people make informed decisions about which EV to buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding Public Charging Stations\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common concerns about EVs is range anxiety – the fear that you’ll run out of power in the middle of a journey. This fear is largely unfounded, as most EVs have plenty of range for everyday driving (often over 200 miles on a single charge). But to alleviate this concern even further, EV Universe also provides maps and listings of public charging stations across the country. Users can search by location, charger type, and even filter for stations that are currently available or have several spots open. With this information at their fingertips, EV owners can plan their routes in advance and feel confident that they’ll never be stranded without power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charging at Home\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important aspect of EV ownership is charging at home. Many EV models come with a home charger, which can be installed in your garage or driveway to allow for convenient overnight charging. EV Universe provides information on how to install these chargers, what kind of power supply is needed, and how to use them safely and efficiently. In addition, the site provides resources for finding qualified electricians who can help with installation if needed. This can be a great way to save money on fuel costs and stay topped up on power without ever having to visit a public charging station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making the Transition to EV Life\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, EV Universe is a valuable resource for anyone interested in making the switch to electric vehicles. By providing information on everything from choosing the right EV to finding public charging stations, EV Universe makes the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable future as easy as possible. Whether you’re a longtime EV owner or just starting to explore the world of electric cars, EV Universe is the perfect guide to help you navigate this exciting new frontier. So why wait? Sign up today and start experiencing the future of transportation for yourself! \n",
