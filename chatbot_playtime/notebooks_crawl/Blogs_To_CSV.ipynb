    "As the wave of electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasm continues to surge, you might be contemplating joining the electric revolution. When we talk about electric car maintenance, we mean the regular checks and care to keep your EV running at its best. Like any vehicle, an electric car needs regular care. However, you’ll be glad to know that maintenance for electric cars tends to be simpler and less frequent than for their gasoline-powered counterparts. With fewer moving parts, electric vehicles skip the need for oil changes, spark plug replacements, or timing belt adjustments – all thanks to the absence of an internal combustion engine.\n",

Without an internal combustion engine (ICE), there’s no need for oil changes, spark plug replacements, or timing belt adjustments.
